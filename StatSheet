/*
 * How to calculate evasion
 * Evade the hit all together :
 * +More complex with calculations
 * +Allows for build variation
 * -Harder to implement in an MMC class
 * -Difficult to put into an ASC but easier to build my own system for
 * +/- Have to add Accuracy stat to make dodge more manageable in pvp
 * 
 * -Balance is difficult
 */


/*
 * Types of Gear :
 * Evasion          - % to dodge hit
 * Defense          - Damage Reduction %
 * EnergyShield     - Shield /Essentailly health
 * 
 * Hybrid Gear Types : Store 40-70% less value of normal gear but have double stats
 * Def/Eva 
 * Def/ES
 * Eva/ES
 * 
 *
 * calculation (Single function for calculations)->
 * 
 * bool evasion (evasion, Accuracy) :
 *  { See if hit landed first }
 * 
 * float Resistance Calculation (WasDodged, Resistance, ResistancePen, DamageAfterReduction) :
 * { 
 *  (1 - resistance) * Dmg
 *  return damage after resistance
 * }
 * float defense (Incoming Damage, defense):
 * {
 *      Calculate Reduction from damage and return;
 * }
 * float EnergyShield (incoming Damage, EnergyShield) :
 * {
 *      Subtract damage and return a value for health handle
 * }
 * float Health (IncomingDamage, Health) :
 * {
 *      Check if (Damage num != 0)
 *      {
 *          subtract damage num from health
 *      }
 *      return health value
 * }
 *  
 * 
 * All are attributes apart of the character
 * ES will recharge after 2 seconds but X% can change the value
